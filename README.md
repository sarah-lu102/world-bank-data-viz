# World Bank Human Rights Data Visualizations

From the [website](https://dornsife.usc.edu/spec/research/):

The World Bankâ€™s Inspection Panel and Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman (CAO) independently respond to complaints made by persons harmed or likely to be harmed by Bank-funded development projects. These quasi-judicial bodies have jointly adjudicated nearly 300 complaints in over 50 countries since 1994, but little is known about their effectiveness. Our team is collecting data on the Inspection Panel and CAO to determine what remedies they provide to affected communities, what factors influence the likelihood of plaintiff success, and what effect litigation has on government respect for human rights.

Undergraduate research assistants have collected data and engaged in codebook revisions. For Summer 2017, we expect to complete data collection and proceed to data visualization and quantitative analysis to assess the determinants of plaintiff success and the effects of litigation on future human rights performance.

## R code and figures for USC's World Bank &amp; Human Rights research project

This respository contains the eleven figures (8 bar plots, 3 heat maps) that I created from scratch. 

Figure 3 compares the outcomes of cases reviewed by institutions

Figures 7a-d show the relationships between the type of human rights issue raised and NGO involvement

Figure 10 shows the relationship between World Bank project type and positive outcomes of cases

Figures 13a-c are log-scaled geographic heatmaps of case occurences 

Figures 14a-b show the relationship between victim complaint quality and NGO involvement
